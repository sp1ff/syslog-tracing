	Cut release 0.2.1

	s/valueset!/valueset_all!/
	Our unit tests rely on the undocumented `tracing` macro `valueset!`.
	`tracing` 0.1.44 (December 18, 2025) introduced a breaking change
	to this macro. This commit moves us to the the also undocumented
	`valueset_all!` macro which now works.

2025-12-04  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Cut release 0.2.0

	Add a _docs.rs to hold more general documentation

	Merge branch 'cbeck88-optional-tracing-metadata-as-syslog-structured-data'

2025-12-04  Chris Beck  <beck.ct@gmail.com>

	Prep this branch for merge:
	    - fix tests
	    - cargo fmt
	    - respect MSRV of 1.82
	    - fixup configuration of tracing-subscriber crate to only enable required features
	    - fix build in edition 2021
	    - use a permalink for the NormalizeMetadata example

2025-12-02  Chris Beck  <beck.ct@gmail.com>

	use "tracing-meta@64700" as the SD-ID by default, and allow override
	this also refactored the tracing-metadata related options to be one
	structure, maybe a little tidier

2025-12-02  Chris Beck  <beck.ct@gmail.com>

	add optional integration with tracing-log
	tracing-log is a bridge that allows tracing to pick up log messages
	written by older rust libraries that used the `log` crate facade.
	the bridge subscribes to log messages and resubmits them as tracing
	events.

	because of lifetime issues, it can't take the log message file and
	line numbers and register them directly as file and line numbers of
	the tracing events. instead it places them as `log.file` and `log.line`
	in the event metadata. then, when using `tracing-subscriber`, the
	metadata are "normalized" by repopulating the file and line number
	information. This normalization is possible when `tracing-log` feature
	is turned on.

	in this commit we mirror this behavior, so that tracing-rfc-5424 will
	also make log messages carry this metadata just as well as tracing messages,
	if the optional `tracing-log` feature is turned on

2025-12-02  Chris Beck  <beck.ct@gmail.com>

	allow sending tracing metadata (target, file/line, module_path) as syslog structured data
	this adds optional features to pass on more of the metadata from the tracing infrastructure
	as structured-data, when using RFC-5424 format.

	it doesn't go as far as sending fields and valuesets from tracing events, but still seems
	like a significant improvement.

	note that `tracing_subscriber` typically defaults to formatting the target
	with the log message in text logs, so many users are used to seeing that in text logs,
	but it's not present in the syslog records produced by this crate before this change.
	in tracing_subscriber, the file and line number are optional defaulting to off.
	in this PR we make all this stuff default to off, for backwards compatible behavior.

	Cut release 0.1.5

2025-11-25  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fix issue #14.
	Switch from `to_rfc3339()` to `to_rfc3339_opts()` with an argument
	of `SecondsFormat::Micros`. This will format all timestamps (for
	the `Rfc5424` formatter with exactly six digits in the subsecond
	field, compliant with RFC 5424. The prior implementation produced
	variable-sized fields, up to nine digits (I believe).

	Add a regression test for the bug.

	Cut release 0.1.4

2025-05-09  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update the codebase ahead of 0.1.4.
	This patch does a few things:

	    - updates the copyright statements throughout
	    - allows the `clippy::uninlined_format_args` lint, which doesn't
	      fire for me locally on my dev machine, but *does* in CI (?)
	    - update the pinned version of rust from 1.69 to 1.82 due to
	      the backtrace dependency

	Fix the Continuous Integration job.
	Three days ago, BurntSushi released version 0.1.8 of the
	`grep-cli` crate:
	<https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/f4d07b9cbdcf7d52e63f35fe76279e99a17492ef>

	In which he raised the minimum rust version supported by `ripgrep`
	to 1.70
	<https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/4fcb1b2202b97c5a21894672232700225223a138>

	Since I just use `ripgrep` for something that could arguably be in
	a pre-commit hook, I'm going to maintain support for rust 1.69 by
	swapping-out ripgrep for good 'ol find-grep.
