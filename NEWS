* 0.2 builds

** 0.2.1 build

*** Bug fixes

**** `tracing` 0.1.44 breaks the unit tests

Use `valueset_all!` instead of `valueset!`.
** 0.2.0 build

*** User-visible Changes

**** Added a _docs.rs for general documentation
**** Support for sending tracing metadata (target, file/line, module_path) as syslog structured data

...when using RFC 5424. This can be enabled via the new APIs on the RFC 5424 builder. When enabled, outbound messages will include e.g. `[tracing-metadata@64700 file="foo.rs" line="97"]`, to be consumed downstream. The SD-ID used here can also be customized.
**** Many unused features of `tracing-subscriber` were turned off

Additionally, `tracing-log` is now an optional dependency of `tracing-rfc5424` rather than a mandatory one, but is on by default for backwards compatibility.
